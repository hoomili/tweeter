# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This project was built to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node and Express back-end skills.

The app will allow users to post tweets and view them live without requiring to refresh the page. it uses asynchronous functionality of the Ajax and jQuery to achieve this task.

The page is designed to work on both small and large screens with minor style changes without breaking. To see the preview of the page, please refer to the screenshots below.
